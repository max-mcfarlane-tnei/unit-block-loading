# Block Loading Optimization for Blackstart Scenario: Example Repository

https://blockloadingapp.herokuapp.com

This repository provides an example implementation of block loading optimization for handling demand and supporting generation during a blackstart scenario in the power system. The repository demonstrates the capabilities and benefits of using mathematical optimization techniques in power system restoration.

⚠️ **Note: This model is a considerable simplification of a real power system optimization process and should not be used in any commercial environment. Its purpose is solely for exemplary purposes to showcase the application of optimization techniques in a blackstart scenario. The problem has been simplified to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for ease of demonstration.**

## Key Features

- **Optimization Algorithms**: The repository includes basic optimization algorithms tailored for block loading scenarios during a blackstart scenario. These algorithms efficiently allocate resources and generation units to meet demand and restore power reliably and quickly.

- **Demand and Generation Modeling**: Simplistic data representations capture the characteristics of demand and generation during a blackstart scenario. The models consider load profiles, resource constraints, and system limitations.

- **Visualization**: Visualization capabilities are included to present the optimization results clearly and insightfully. Users can generate charts and graphs that showcase optimized block loading schedules and resource allocations.
