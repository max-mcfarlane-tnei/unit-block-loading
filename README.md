# Block Loading Optimisation for Blackstart Scenario: Example Repository

https://blockloadingapp.herokuapp.com

This repository provides an example implementation of block loading optimisation for handling demand and supporting generation during a blackstart scenario in the power system. The repository demonstrates the capabilities and benefits of using mathematical optimisation techniques in power system restoration.

⚠️ **Note: This model is a considerable simplification of a real power system optimisation process and should not be used in any commercial environment. Its purpose is solely for exemplary purposes to showcase the application of optimisation techniques in a blackstart scenario. The problem has been simplified to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for ease of demonstration.**

## Key Features

- **Optimisation Algorithms**: The repository includes basic optimisation algorithms tailored for block loading scenarios during a blackstart scenario. These algorithms efficiently allocate resources and generation units to meet demand and restore power reliably and quickly.

- **Demand and Generation Modelling**: Simplistic data representations capture the characteristics of demand and generation during a blackstart scenario. The models consider load profiles, resource constraints, and system limitations.

- **Visualisation**: Visualisation capabilities are included to present the optimisation results clearly and insightfully. Users can generate charts and graphs that showcase optimised block loading schedules and resource allocations.

- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Documentation and tutorials will be released soon.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: The mathematical optimisation techniques employed in this repository ensure efficient allocation of resources and generation units, reducing downtime and minimising restoration time during a blackstart scenario.

- **Reliability**: The optimisation algorithms meet demand while adhering to operational constraints.

- **Cost Savings**: By optimising the block loading process, this repository minimises the need for additional resources and generation capacity, resulting in cost savings for power system operators.

- **Scalability**: The repository is not designed to handle large systems. It does exemplify the underlying processes that a future soltion can be tailored for.

- **Decision Support**: Visualisation and reporting capabilities provide actionable insights and a holistic view of the block loading optimisation results, aiding decision-making by operators and stakeholders in effectively managing blackstart scenarios.
