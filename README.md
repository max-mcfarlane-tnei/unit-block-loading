# Block Loading Optimization for Blackstart Scenario: Example Repository

This repository provides an example implementation of block loading optimization for handling demand and supporting generation during a blackstart scenario in the power system. The repository demonstrates the capabilities and benefits of using mathematical optimization techniques in power system restoration.

⚠️ **Note: This model is a considerable simplification of a real power system optimization process and should not be used in any commercial environment. Its purpose is solely for exemplary purposes to showcase the application of optimization techniques in a blackstart scenario. The problem has been simplified to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for ease of demonstration.**
